# Secure Documents

RocketDirectory can have "secure documents" which are NOT available to the public, only registered users or users in a certain role can access the documents.  

## Turn on Secure documents
"Secure Documents" can be turned on by checking the checkbox in the "Admin Settings" or the system.

Once turned on the documents are upload as normal, but the download in the link needs to be created with a dowload API.
